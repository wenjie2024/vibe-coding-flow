# Document Maintainer

This skill helps you keep project documentation synchronized with the codebase. It analyzes recent git changes and suggests updates to documentation files.

## When to Use

- After completing a significant feature or refactor.
- When `README.md` or `implementation_plan.md` assumes outdated implementation details.
- To verify if documentation reflects the current codebase state.

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze Changes**: Run the analysis script to see what code has changed.
2.  **Review Suggestions**: The script will output a summary of changes and suggest documentation updates.
3.  **Apply Updates**: You (the Agent) should apply the updates to the markdown files using your file editing tools.

## Tools

### Analyze Changes

Run the following script to analyze the git diff and identify impacted documentation:

```bash
python .agent/skills/doc-maintainer/scripts/analyze.py --since HEAD~1
```

*(Note: Adjust `--since` to cover the relevant commit range if needed)*

## Rules

1.  **Truth Source**: The Code is the source of truth. If docs contradict code, fix the docs.
2.  **Conciseness**: Don't narrate the diff; summarize the *impact* on the user or developer.
3.  **Safety**: Do not overwrite `productContext.md` (Requirements) unless the user explicitly requested a requirement change.
